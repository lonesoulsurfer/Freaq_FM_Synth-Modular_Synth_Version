# Freaq_FM_Synth-Modular_Synth_Version
 The awesome Freaq FM Synth by MeeBleeps - designed for Eurorack Synths

First and foremost - I need to do a huge shoutout to MeeBleeps who designed this amazing synth. 

I've designed the PCB and front panel to suit a Eurorack  so if you are into modular synths then this synth would fit perfectly into your rack! It can be run from 12V power supply and also has a power connector used on on Euroracks.

It also can be used as a standalone synth and hand on heart, holds up to most mini synths you can buy.

The main goal with building this module is to create a modular synth. I wanted to keep everything as simple as possble with each module built on the following aims:

 - Can be powered by 9V (and 12V)
 - Easy to build with minimum components
 - Use Arduino to keep it simple (plus it helps to keep the components down!
 - Can fit into any modular synth Eurorck (include the ability to power the module via normal module power sources
 - Has to sound great!

Hang-on I haven't even talked about what the Freq can do!

The Freaq features dual independent 2-operator FM voices paired with a 2-track generative sequencer. You can stack the voices so they are in unison or have them in different polymeric step-counts. This allows you to have one voice play bass and the other lead.

This is one funky little machine! There are a tonne of controls and waveforms along with attack/delay envelope and LFO per voice.
