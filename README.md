# Freaq_FM_Synth-Modular_Synth_Version

 The awesome Freaq FM Synth by MeeBleeps - designed for Eurorack Synths

First and foremost - I need to do a huge shoutout to MeeBleeps who designed this amazing synth! - https://github.com/Meebleeps/MeeBleeps-Freaq-FM-Synth

My contribution has been the design of a PCB and front panel to suit a Eurorack to suit modular synth builds.  It can be run from 12V power supply via a power connector used on on Euroracks or a 9V power supply via a JST connector.

It also can be used as a standalone synth and hand on heart, holds up to most mini synths you can buy.

The main goal with building this module is to create my own 'simple to build' modular synth. I wanted to keep everything as easy as possble with each module built with the following aims:

 - Can be powered by 9V (and 12V)
 - Easy to build with minimum components
 - Use Arduino to keep it simple (plus it helps to keep the components down and everything in tune)
 - Can fit into any modular synth Eurorck (include the ability to power the module via normal module power sources)
 - Has to sound great!

I've created a step by step guide on my Instructables page which you can find below.  This goes through how to upload the sketch using the correct version of Mozzie (1.1.2).

The Freaq FM Synth features dual independent 2-operator FM voices paired with a 2-track generative sequencer. You can stack the voices so they are in unison or have them in different polymeric step-counts. This allows you to have one voice play bass and the other lead.

This is one funky little machine! There are a tonne of controls and waveforms along with attack/delay envelope and LFO per voice.

Full instructions can be found in the Github repository
